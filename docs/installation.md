# Installation

## Requirements

- Linux
- Python 3.11+
- systemd for the supported deployment path

Recommended:

- reverse proxy for public exposure
- fast local storage for SQLite
- fail2ban

## Validated Platforms

The deploy scripts have been validated on:

- Debian 12 and 13
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and 25.10
- Fedora 42 and 43 with SELinux enforcing
- CentOS Stream 9 and 10 with SELinux enforcing
- AlmaLinux 8, 9, and 10 with SELinux enforcing
- Rocky Linux 8, 9, and 10 with SELinux enforcing

Not yet directly validated:

- Raspberry Pi OS / Raspbian
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Oracle Linux

Support guidance:

- RHEL-family support is strongly indicated by the validated CentOS Stream, AlmaLinux, and Rocky Linux paths
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux should be described as expected to work on 9/10-class systems, but not yet directly tested
- Oracle Linux is likely to work as an EL-family target, but it should stay in the unvalidated bucket until it is tested directly
- Raspberry Pi OS / Raspbian is plausible on 64-bit Debian-family images, but should not be claimed as tested yet

Do not target older distro baselines for the supported deployment path:

- Debian 11
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- CentOS 7
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and below
- Oracle Linux 7 and below

Reason:

- pyCluster requires Python 3.11+
- older distro baselines are too old for the current dependency/runtime requirements

## Hardware and Resource Guidance

Minimum practical node:

- 1 vCPU
- 1 GB RAM
- 10 GB disk

Recommended small production node:

- 2 vCPU
- 2 GB RAM
- 20 GB SSD-backed disk

Additional notes:

- 1 GB RAM works, but leaves less headroom during package operations and service restarts
- EL-family hosts with 1 GB RAM may require temporary swap during package installation; the deploy scripts handle that automatically
- if you plan to run reverse proxy, TLS, fail2ban, and longer spot retention on the same host, prefer 2 GB RAM or better

## Local Development Install

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Run the core service:

```bash
pycluster --config ./config/pycluster.toml serve
```

If you need machine-local settings, create `./config/pycluster.local.toml`. pyCluster automatically loads it after the base `pycluster.toml`, so local edits do not need to live in the tracked repo file.

## Production Install

From the repo root:

```bash
cd /usr/src
git clone https://github.com/AI3I/pyCluster.git
cd pyCluster
sudo ./deploy/install.sh
sudo ./deploy/doctor.sh
```

Recommended layout for a host-level install:

- checkout under `/usr/src/pyCluster`
- let `deploy/install.sh` create the `pycluster` system user and group automatically
- use a clean standalone Linux host dedicated to pyCluster rather than trying to combine it with unrelated products or pre-existing service bundles

There is no separate pre-install account creation step for the operator to perform.

Interactive installs now also offer to run nginx setup before finishing. That prompt asks for:

- the public hostname for the user web UI
- an optional separate hostname for the sysop web UI
- whether nginx should publish ports `80` and `443`
- whether to use Let's Encrypt or self-signed TLS
- the email address required by Let's Encrypt

If you skip nginx setup, pyCluster still installs and starts cleanly, but:

- the sysop web UI stays on `127.0.0.1:8080`
- the public web UI stays on `127.0.0.1:8081`
- those listeners are local-only until you publish them with nginx or another reverse proxy

Skipping nginx setup does not change the supported deployment model. The intended path is still a pyCluster-owned nginx configuration on the pyCluster host, not grafting pyCluster into some unrelated existing reverse-proxy layout later.
`deploy/setup-nginx.sh` is the supported out-of-the-gate path for wiring nginx to host ports `80` and `443`, and it now fails fast if another non-nginx service already owns those ports.

This installs:

- application tree under `/home/pycluster/pyCluster`
- `pycluster.service`
- `pyclusterweb.service`
- `pycluster-cty-refresh.timer`
  - keeps `CTY.DAT` and `wpxloc.raw` current from the Country Files refresh path
- `pycluster-retention.timer`
- fail2ban filters and jails for pyCluster auth failures
- logrotate policy for `/var/log/pycluster/authfail.log`
- an initial `SYSOP` account bootstrap note at `/root/pycluster-initial-sysop.txt`

During install and repair, pyCluster now prints the bootstrap `SYSOP` credentials prominently in the terminal, saves the same note to `/root/pycluster-initial-sysop.txt`, and pauses interactive installs until the operator explicitly acknowledges that the credentials were reviewed.

## Upgrade

```bash
sudo ./deploy/upgrade.sh
sudo ./deploy/doctor.sh
```

The supported scripted upgrade path covers `1.0.0` and later. `deploy/upgrade.sh` runs the cumulative migration chain required by older installs before services restart. The current chain includes:

- `run_upgrade_1_0_1`
  - hash legacy plaintext user passwords
  - seed `config/strings.toml` when it is missing
- `run_upgrade_1_0_6`
  - move any embedded outbound peer `password=` values out of DSNs and into the separate peer-password preference path used by current pyCluster

`deploy/upgrade.sh`, `deploy/repair.sh`, and `deploy/uninstall.sh` also create timestamped runtime backups under `/root/pycluster-backups/` before making destructive changes to the live tree.

Recommended before future upgrades:

- keep `config/pycluster.toml` close to upstream defaults
- move host-specific changes into `config/pycluster.local.toml`
- leave `config/pycluster.local.toml` untracked so `git pull --ff-only` stays clean

That local override file is also the right place for host-specific secrets such as QRZ credentials, SMTP credentials, and any node identity or listener changes that should survive repo updates.

SMTP should also be treated as part of the pyCluster host configuration. The supported path is to configure the mail settings pyCluster needs for its own delivery behavior, not to assume pyCluster is meant to be bolted onto some unrelated pre-existing mail stack without dedicated setup.

## Repair

```bash
sudo ./deploy/repair.sh
```

## Uninstall

Keep config and data:

```bash
sudo ./deploy/uninstall.sh
```

## DXSpider Migration

After pyCluster is installed, the first migration pass from DXSpider is available through:

```bash
sudo ./deploy/migrate.sh --from-dxspider /spider --dry-run
sudo ./deploy/migrate.sh --from-dxspider /spider
```

See [Migration](migration.md) for details and current scope.

Current migration behavior also includes:

- simple outbound DXSpider peer import from `connect/*`
- exact `badip.local` IP entries exported to `config/fail2ban-badip.local`
- reconciliation of imported exact IPs into the active pyCluster fail2ban block set
- unsupported connect scripts and CIDR-style `badip.local` entries are reported, not guessed

Remove config and data too:

```bash
sudo KEEP_CONFIG=0 KEEP_DATA=0 ./deploy/uninstall.sh
```

## First Checks

```bash
systemctl status pycluster.service pyclusterweb.service
sudo ./deploy/doctor.sh
```

If the first install created the bootstrap account successfully, you should also see:

```bash
sudo ls -l /root/pycluster-initial-sysop.txt
```

That file contains the one-time generated `SYSOP` password for first web-based operator login.

If the install is interactive, the deploy script now stops and requires `READ` confirmation before it continues past the bootstrap credential notice.

## MFA Recovery

Normal operator recovery paths:

- System Console: use `Reset MFA` on the user record
- Telnet sysop command: `sysop/clearmfa <call>`

Both paths:

- force `mfa_email_otp=off` for the principal/base callsign
- clear outstanding OTP challenges for that callsign and its SSIDs
- leave the password unchanged
- write an audit record

If every sysop is locked out, recover locally on the host:

```bash
cd /home/pycluster/pyCluster
sqlite3 data/pycluster.db "
DELETE FROM mfa_challenges;
DELETE FROM user_prefs WHERE call='AI3I' AND pref_key='mfa_email_otp';
INSERT INTO user_prefs(call,pref_key,pref_value,updated_epoch)
VALUES('AI3I','mfa_email_otp','off',strftime('%s','now'))
ON CONFLICT(call,pref_key) DO UPDATE SET
  pref_value=excluded.pref_value,
  updated_epoch=excluded.updated_epoch;
"
systemctl restart pycluster.service pyclusterweb.service
```

Replace `AI3I` with the principal/base sysop callsign you are recovering. If needed, also reset the password through the existing bootstrap or direct SQLite recovery path.

## Registration Recovery

Ordinary-user registration now tracks:

- registration state
- verified email status
- grace logins remaining before lockout

Normal operator recovery paths:

- System Console user editor:
  - `Send Verification`
  - `Mark Verified`
  - `Unlock Account`

If an account is locked or stuck pending verification and you need to recover it locally on the host:

```bash
cd /home/pycluster/pyCluster
sqlite3 data/pycluster.db "
DELETE FROM mfa_challenges;
DELETE FROM user_prefs WHERE call='AI3I' AND pref_key IN ('email_verified_epoch','registration_state','grace_logins_remaining');
INSERT INTO user_prefs(call,pref_key,pref_value,updated_epoch)
VALUES('AI3I','registration_state','pending',strftime('%s','now'))
ON CONFLICT(call,pref_key) DO UPDATE SET
  pref_value=excluded.pref_value,
  updated_epoch=excluded.updated_epoch;
INSERT INTO user_prefs(call,pref_key,pref_value,updated_epoch)
VALUES('AI3I','grace_logins_remaining','5',strftime('%s','now'))
ON CONFLICT(call,pref_key) DO UPDATE SET
  pref_value=excluded.pref_value,
  updated_epoch=excluded.updated_epoch;
"
systemctl restart pycluster.service pyclusterweb.service
```

Replace `AI3I` with the principal/base callsign and adjust `5` to match your configured `initial_grace_logins` policy if needed.

## Retention and Cleanup

pyCluster supports scheduled age-based cleanup for:

- spots
- messages
- bulletins

The scheduler is installed as:

- `pycluster-retention.timer`

You can manage retention from the System Operator web UI or run cleanup manually through the UI action.

## Log Rotation

The deploy scripts install logrotate coverage for:

- `/var/log/pycluster/authfail.log`

That policy rotates weekly, keeps compressed history, and prevents the auth-failure log from growing without bound on long-running nodes.

## Default Ports

- telnet: `7300`
- sysop web: `8080`
- public web: `8081`

Default bind behavior:

- telnet listens publicly unless you change `telnet.host`
- the sysop web service listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`
- the public web service listens on `127.0.0.1:8081`

That localhost binding is intentional. A fresh install is not meant to expose the web UI directly until you finish reverse-proxy setup.
That is part of the standalone deployment model: pyCluster expects you to complete its own reverse-proxy setup cleanly, not to co-mingle it into an unrelated existing web stack and assume equivalent behavior.

## Reverse Proxy Setup

The supported reverse-proxy path is:

```bash
sudo ./deploy/setup-nginx.sh
```

You can also let `deploy/install.sh` call that for you interactively during first install.
That script is intended to claim `80/443` for the pyCluster nginx deployment path on the host. If another non-nginx service is already bound there, it stops with a clear error instead of silently fighting the existing web stack.

Typical nginx setup choices:

- `--public-host cluster.example.net`
- optional `--sysop-host sysop.example.net`
- `--tls-mode none`
- `--tls-mode self-signed`
- `--tls-mode letsencrypt --email admin@example.net`

## Optional Dependencies

Serial/KISS support:

```bash
pip install pyserial
```
